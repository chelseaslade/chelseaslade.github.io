                <p>I'm passionate about many things, including but not limited to programming, design & illustration,
                biological science, and literature. I have a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry (Nutrition) from Memorial University of
                Newfoundland and Labrador, and frequently indulge in free online skills classes. In my free time, I
                enjoy walks with my husband and our energetic pup Suki along the coast of sunny Conception Bay South,
                and painting colourful birds and buildings that remind me of home.</p>
                <p>I look forward to a continued career in the amazing technology industry here in Newfoundland and
                Labrador!</p>
